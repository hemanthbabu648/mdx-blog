# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building full-stack web applications a breeze. With the release of version 15, it brings even more exciting features to the table.

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages over traditional React applications:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Better SEO and faster initial page loads
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time
3. **API Routes**: Build your backend API within the same project
4. **File-based Routing**: Intuitive routing system based on your file structure
5. **Built-in Optimizations**: Automatic code splitting, image optimization, and more

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the necessary configurations.

## Key Features in Next.js 15

### 1. Turbopack

Next.js 15 comes with Turbopack, a Rust-based bundler that's significantly faster than webpack. Enable it with:

```bash
npm run dev --turbopack
```

### 2. App Router

The App Router provides a more intuitive way to handle routing and layouts:

```jsx
// app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 3. Server Components

React Server Components allow you to render components on the server, reducing the JavaScript sent to the client:

```jsx
// This component runs on the server
async function BlogPost({ id }) {
  const post = await fetchPost(id);
  return <article>{post.content}</article>;
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use Server Components by default
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Optimize images with the `next/image` component
- Leverage ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for dynamic content
- Use environment variables for configuration

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. Its powerful features and optimizations make it suitable for projects of any size, from personal blogs to large-scale applications.
