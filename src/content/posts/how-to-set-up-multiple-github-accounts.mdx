Managing multiple GitHub accounts (like personal and work) on the same machine can
be tricky if not set up properly. This guide walks you through setting up separate
SSH keys, configuring Git, and switching seamlessly between accounts.

## **✅ Prerequisites**

Before diving in, make sure you have:

    - Git installed on your system (`git --version`)
    - A GitHub account (or two)
    - Basic knowledge of command line usage

<br />

## **🗝️ Step 1: Generate SSH Keys for Each Account**

We'll generate separate SSH keys for your personal and work accounts.

### **Personal GitHub account**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "you@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal
```

### **Work GitHub account**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "you@work.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

This creates two key pairs:

- `~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal` & `~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal.pub`
- `~/.ssh/id_rsa_work` & `~/.ssh/id_rsa_work.pub`

<br />
## **🔗 Step 2: Add SSH Keys to GitHub**

1. Go to GitHub → **Settings** → **SSH and GPG keys** → **New SSH key**
2. Add:

   - For personal: `id_rsa_personal.pub`
   - For work: `id_rsa_work.pub`

3. Use a meaningful title for each key (e.g., “Personal Laptop”, “Work Laptop”).

<br />
## **🧼 Step 3: Adding SSH Keys to the SSH Agent**

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

Repeat these steps for each GitHub account, replacing file paths with the correct key names.

<br />
## **🛠️ Step 4: Create or Edit SSH Config**

Open (or create) your SSH config file:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Add the following:

```ssh
# Personal GitHub account
Host github.com-personal
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal

# Work GitHub account
Host github.com-work
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

<br />

## **🧪 Step 5: Test SSH Connections**

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com-personal
ssh -T git@github.com-work
```

You should see:

> Hi `<username>`! You've successfully authenticated… for both.

<br />

## **📂 Step 6: Clone Repositories with Correct Host**

When cloning, use the correct host alias:

```bash
# Personal repo
git clone git@github.com-personal:your-username/repo-name.git

# Work repo
git clone git@github.com-work:work-username/repo-name.git
```

<br />
## **🔧 Step 7: Set Git Identity Per Project**

You can set identity per project:

```bash
cd ~/path/to/personal-repo
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "you@example.com"

cd ~/path/to/work-repo
git config user.name "Your Work Name"
git config user.email "you@work.com"
```

<br />

## **🧠 Conclusion**

Managing multiple GitHub accounts on the same machine is totally doable with a little SSH and Git config magic. By separating your keys and using SSH aliases, you can avoid headaches and context-switch seamlessly.

<br />

Now you can:

✅ Work with both personal and professional repos  
✅ Keep identities clean and separate  
✅ Avoid constant re-authentication or mistakes
