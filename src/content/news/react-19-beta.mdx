# React 19 Beta: What's New for Developers

The React team has released the beta version of React 19, introducing several groundbreaking features that promise to revolutionize how we build user interfaces.

## Major Updates

### Automatic Batching
React 19 automatically batches state updates across different event sources, improving performance without code changes.

### New Hooks
- `useOptimistic`: Optimistically update UI before server confirmation
- `useFormStatus`: Track form submission states easily
- `use`: Simplified data fetching and promise handling

### Improved Concurrent Features
Enhanced Suspense boundaries and better streaming SSR support make building responsive applications easier.

## Migration Guide

The React team has provided comprehensive migration guides and codemods to help developers upgrade smoothly from React 18.

Beta testing is ongoing, with the stable release expected in early 2025.
